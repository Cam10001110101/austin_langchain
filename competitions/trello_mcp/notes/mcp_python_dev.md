# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Python Development Research

## Overview

Research notes on implementing Model Context Protocol servers in Python, focusing on understanding core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Research Goals

1. Understand MCP architecture and core concepts
2. Identify Python-specific implementation patterns
3. Document key components needed for Python MCP server development
4. Gather best practices and examples

## Research Notes

### Core Protocol Components

1. Core Architecture
2. Resources - Data sources that MCP servers make available to clients
3. Tools - Executable functionality exposed by MCP servers
4. Prompts - Structured communication format
5. Sampling - Data handling mechanisms

### Python Implementation Components

1. Python SDK

   - Official SDK available for Python implementation
   - Provides framework for building MCP servers and clients

2. Key Server Components
   - Server implementation examples available
   - Client implementation examples available
   - Need to investigate:
     - Request/Response handling
     - State management
     - Transport layer configuration
     - Tool and Resource definitions

### Python SDK Implementation Details

1. Installation & Setup

   - Package: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (Python package)
   - Available through pip/PyPI
   - Core dependencies to be determined from package setup

2. Server Implementation Structure

   - Server class definition
   - Request handlers configuration
   - Transport layer setup (e.g., stdio)
   - Tool and resource definitions
   - Error handling implementation

3. Key Components to Implement
   - Server initialization and configuration
   - Request/Response handling logic
   - Tool definitions and handlers
   - Resource management
   - Transport layer configuration
   - Error handling and logging

### Next Steps for Trello MCP Development

1. Set up Python development environment
2. Install MCP SDK and dependencies
3. Create basic server structure
4. Implement Trello API integration
5. Define tools for Trello operations (CRUD)
6. Test and validate implementation
