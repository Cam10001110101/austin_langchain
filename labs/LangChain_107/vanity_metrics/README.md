# GitHub Repository Analysis Tool

This Python-based tool is designed to fetch star counts for GitHub repositories and compare these counts against the total number of repositories on GitHub to determine the relative popularity of a specific repository.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `requests` library
- `python-dotenv` library for loading environment variables

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/austin_langchain.git
   cd austin_langchain
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install requests python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Configure your GitHub token:**

   - Create a `.env` file in your home directory or the project directory.
   - Add your GitHub token to the `.env` file:

     ```plaintext
     GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token_here
     ```

   Ensure your token has the necessary permissions (`public_repo`) to fetch public repository data.

## Usage

To run the program, navigate to the project directory and execute the `analysis.py` script:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

This will output the star count for the repository configured in the script, the total number of repositories with at least that many stars, and the percentage representation of how popular the repository is compared to others.

## Modifying the Target Repository

To change the target repository (currently set to `colinmcnamara/austin_langchain`), edit the `analysis.py` file:

1. Change the `owner` and `repo` variables to match the new target repository's owner and name.

   ```python
   owner = 'new_owner'
   repo = 'new_repository'
   ```

## Updating `github_api.py`

If additional GitHub API functionalities are needed, update or extend the `github_api.py` module:

1. Add new functions to make different API calls as needed.
2. Use appropriate error handling and request headers as shown in the existing functions.
