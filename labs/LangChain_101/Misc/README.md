# Overview

1. [101-1-streamlit_llamacpp_mistral.ipynb](101-1-streamlit_llamacpp_mistral.ipynb)  
This notebook is a variation on the original [101-1-streamlit_streaming.ipynb](../101-1-streamlit_streaming.ipynb)  
It uses an alternative model called Mistral 7b locally instead of making api  
calls to OpenAI.
2. [101-1-mistral-chatbot](101-1-mistral-chatbot)  
This is a standalone python application and doesn't require a notebook to run. You may run this locally on your  
computer with or without a GPU. Note that your mileage may vary when running solely on a CPU. The chatbot is created  
with easy of deployment in mind and can be deployed in a "production" environment with very little effort.
