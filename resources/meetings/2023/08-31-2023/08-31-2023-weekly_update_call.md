## Topics

Kevin / Colin / Charles Sync - AGI Meetup
## Summary



Colin is co-authoring a white paper with a friend of mine on a project on data ingestion through ai ml pipeline.

### Meetup 



There is a lot of utility in targeting development purpose to keep it limited to length chain or making lang the heart of it.

###  The Austin AI meetup.

Austin is a great opportunity for one to learn a lot and be positioned with learners that are focused in this new area.

Austin wants to be one of the places where there are a lot of things happening, and create a magnet for people who are technical enough.

The opportunity to build something substantial out of data science. 


Kevin shared his perspective on being surrounded by the people who are driving the initiative to build something substantial out of the opportunity that now exists.

There is a window right now that will close pretty soon where people have not yet figured out exactly what this is about.

### Approachability of the course. 

The approachability of the course and how it can be given to anyone who is willing to show up and give it a shot.

The goal is to build a community.

Colin wants to make it really simple. He wants to push it out to the week after next and give people time to make plans around it.

#### What day should we start the meetup? 

A beginner session is more appealing for bringing in numbers, but it becomes interesting to see who comes again and if they are building momentum.

Tuesday evening is a good night

Seven o'clock is presentation, then learning, learning and playing. From 7:30 to a short talk and then playing with stuff.

Personal goal is not to gain maximum people, but to create quality people.

### availabilty for dry runs

Charles is available next week to sit at a bar and do some stuff. They will be in a different bar than in Denver.
