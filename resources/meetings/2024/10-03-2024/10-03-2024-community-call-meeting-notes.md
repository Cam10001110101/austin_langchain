## Discussion Points

### 10/2 Event Review
* **What Went Well:**
    - The new event space was great and felt like a mini-conference.
    - Layout changes (moving from a collaborative conference table to panel style) provided a more formal feel, though still interactive due to facilitation style.
  
* **What Could Be Improved:**
    - AV setup could be better planned in advance, with feedback from live mics and delayed recording start issues. 
    - Action: Ensure AV technician is present well ahead of events.

### AV Planning for Future Events
* The event had AV challenges, including a malfunctioning 4K camera (slow-motion/time-lapse), and backups like GoPro were used.
* Cameron suggested setting up a live-switching system for better AV control during events.
* Colin will coordinate an AV setup day with volunteers to test equipment and create a detailed plan, including diagrams and equipment lists, to improve future AV experiences.

### Scheduling Next Hacky Hour on Meetup
