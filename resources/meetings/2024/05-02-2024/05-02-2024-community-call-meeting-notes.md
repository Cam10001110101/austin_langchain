## Discussion Points

### AI Models and Media Generation
* Karim discussed exploring textual audio models for conversational agents and shared information about a company that uses stable diffusion to generate images and lyrics. He mentioned the possibility of testing out song renditions using available tokens for generating media.
* Colin expressed interest in running a collab notebook from the company's GitHub, while Ricky inquired about potential applications of the technology.

The discussion highlighted smart contracts enabling various interactions with tokenized media, leading to an exchange between Colin and Rob regarding real-world applications and business implications.

### Deployment Strategies and Cloud Infrastructure
* A detailed conversation ensued about deployment strategies involving Google Cloud's infrastructure superiority compared to other platforms like OCI.
* Discussions progressed beyond basic one-on-one training towards advanced deployment concepts such as serverless implementation using Google Cloud services like Cloud Run or alternatives like AWS Lambda were considered due to their scalability benefits without incurring costs when idle.
* The team discussed ensuring portability across different cloud platforms for application development without being tied to specific vendor APIs. They highlighted using serverless options like Google Cloud Run while maintaining flexibility to deploy applications on various platforms such as Amazon or Microsoft without reliance on platform-specific APIs.

### Community Engagement and Event Planning
* Colin proposed incorporating birds-of-a-feather sessions during breaks where participants can engage in read-backs regarding deployment patterns and potential improvements within scalable patterns involving A/B deployments along with addressing data localization issues and cost optimization strategies.
* The team discussed organizing an event, considering the demand for a new format due to time constraints in their in-person sessions. Colin proposed combining existing concepts and activities, such as one-on-one sessions, lunch breaks, cloud deployment discussions, and a hacky hour.
