Colin mentioned working on PowerPoint or Google Slides visuals related to upcoming labs connected with Google Drive integration while ensuring Scott had ample time if he wished to present at an upcoming virtual session.

* Facilitator Role Assignment
Charles expressed interest in taking up a facilitator role during sessions due to confidence limitations regarding presentations but willingness towards fostering dialogue among participants through polls.

### In persion session - LangGraph lab
* Lang Graph Exploration
Colin and Ricky discussed exploring Lang Graph concepts before their upcoming meeting on February 21st. They expressed excitement about delving into Lang Graph's documentation and agents' functionalities.

* Utilizing Smartboards in Meetings
Colin proposed utilizing smartboards as digital whiteboards during in-person meetings to capture artifacts from discussions through visual representations on a larger screen. Scott supported this idea by acknowledging its potential effectiveness.

* Scheduling In-Person Meeting
The team settled on holding an in-person meeting on February 21st after considering various dates including Valentine's Day (February 14th) which was deemed unsuitable due to personal commitments.

* Presentation Tools and Techniques
The team discussed the use of visual aids, such as whiteboards and flowcharts, to enhance presentations during in-person and virtual meetings. Colin suggested using drawings to facilitate collaboration during in-person meetings, while Ricky expressed interest in practicing drawing beforehand. Scott shared his experience with using flowcharts for virtual talks. The team agreed that visual representations like nodes with edges could be beneficial for conveying complex ideas.

* Lang Graph Implementation
There was a shift towards focusing on implementing Lang Graph instead of Prometheus for capturing metrics. Ricky proposed concentrating more on Lang Graph, which Colin supported by likening it to a Docker Compose file or Helm repository for controlling multi-agent frameworks via a repository.

### Spring Hack Party Plannin
* Venue Exploration
The discussion revolved around exploring potential venues for future events. Scott recommended visiting a space he mentioned previously, which would be available at the end of the year due to ongoing development work transforming its parking lot into an area featuring food trucks and music venues.
* Charles suggested keeping the size under 40 as it's our first run, and discussed the challenges of SXSW Scheduling
