## Summary
Event Planning
Colin discussed planning for the VT March 7 event and proposed a hacky hour with a prize or competition element on the third. The discussion also touched upon an in-person event scheduled for March 20, and Karim suggested adding office hours to the agenda. Additionally, there was mention of increasing engagement on Discord.

### Engagement Strategies
Karim sought input on strategies to enhance engagement on Discord. Colin recommended open communication and learning in public, emphasizing transparency as a means of fostering engagement.

### Virtual Event Preparation
Ricky expressed concerns about his slide preparation for an upcoming virtual event but received reassurance from Colin to focus on delivering content comfortably rather than feeling pressured. They agreed that even if one person benefits from the session, it adds value.

### Technical Preparations
Charles mentioned potential work obligations conflicting with his availability for an upcoming event but committed to making efforts to attend. There was also discussion about technical issues during previous events and plans not to complicate things further.

### Video Presentation Improvement
Charles acknowledged causing technical issues during past events due to menu settings confusion but assured others that he would avoid making similar mistakes in future presentations.

### Community Philosophy
The conversation delved into philosophical aspects of community building, emphasizing openness and sharing knowledge without monetary expectations while acknowledging individual professional commitments outside the group's activities.

### Document Collaboration and Publishing
Colin discussed the potential for collaborative writing sessions to create Markdown files, which could be compiled into larger documents for publication. He mentioned the possibility of publishing these documents on platforms like Kindle Free Store. Ricky expressed agreement with this approach, emphasizing the ease of working with such documents.

### Scheduling AV Setup
Colin and Charles discussed scheduling a time for an audio-visual setup before a specific date. They considered available room times and planned to book a room in advance to ensure availability.

### Development Environment Setup
The team deliberated on creating a development environment that allows safer code development within AI systems. They explored using containers with pre-installed packages for enhanced development experience while ensuring security measures are in place.

### Tools Discussion
Ricky expressed interest in discussing tools during an upcoming session, focusing on completing an application related to ligraph. Karim proposed exploring multimodal text-to-image and image-to-text functionalities as part of the discussion agenda.

### Data Security Measures
Charles advocated for exploring obfuscation layers to enable local processing of sensitive data sets without transmitting proprietary information to cloud-based AI systems. The team brainstormed methods involving local language model (LLM) functionality combined with cloud-based processing while safeguarding sensitive data from exposure.

### Planning Future Labs and Workshops
The team strategized about conducting future labs focused on demonstrating various approaches towards handling personally identifiable information (PII) within LLM environments, aiming at making these concepts accessible even for non-coders or individuals less familiar with PII regulations.

### Named Entity Recognition and Data Libraries
Karim discussed the use of local LM approach and data science libraries such as LTK and Spacey for named entity recognition, identifying entities like human names, organizations, institutions, or places. He highlighted the extraction of information from these libraries without requiring heuristic-based or pre-trained models.

### Cosine Similarity Calculation on Names
Charles raised a question about cosine similarity calculation on names and its semantic content when chunking different names. He expressed uncertainty about how this computation would work due to the limited semantic content in individual names.

### Vector Embeddings and Semantic Meaning
Karim explained that words gain meaning through training in vector embeddings rather than having inherent meaning when chunked up. He elaborated that cosine similarity is based on relationships established during training to encapsulate those relationships within embeddings.

### Hackathon Opportunity for PII Problem
Colin suggested using the PII problem as an opportunity for a hackathon with potential prizes to encourage participation. He emphasized driving discussions around identifying, restricting, releasing, and controlling PII while incorporating sample code into Central Texas' knowledge graph.

### Office Hours Scheduling
The team discussed scheduling office hours via Discord for technical discussions as well as product-focused conversations. They considered setting up recurring sessions at specific times during weekdays or weekends based on availability while also exploring video-based interactions with multiple channels within Discord.

### Scheduling Recurring Office Hours
Colin and Karim discussed the possibility of holding recurring office hours on Tuesdays from 2 to 3 PM, with Charles also expressing willingness to allocate that time for this purpose. They agreed to run a one-month experiment starting on the 19th and announced their plan in advance for others' convenience. The goal was to increase engagement on Discord by creating a consistent schedule at the same time every week.

### Leveraging Discord Interface
The team considered leveraging the Discord interface for their office hours, including experimenting with video calls and screen sharing. They also discussed using small incentives as seen in other initiatives like Hacky Hour and Oxen's Friday calls.

### Adjusting Meeting Time
Karim mentioned a scheduling conflict with another call overlapping with their current meeting time, proposing moving it to 2:30 PM instead of 2 PM central time. Colin expressed flexibility regarding his changing work schedule in upcoming weeks due to new office space opening up.

### Acknowledging Flexibility and Commitment
Charles acknowledged his flexibility regarding adjusting meeting times while ensuring he could protect the proposed new slot at 2:30 PM. All members appreciated each other's flexibility during these discussions.

### Recap of Agreed Actions
After finalizing various decisions, such as scheduling recurring office hours, discussing leveraging Discord features, adjusting meeting times, they summarized all agreed actions including reaching out to Ricky about availability at 02:30 pm., conducting an experiment for one month with office hours starting from April third.
